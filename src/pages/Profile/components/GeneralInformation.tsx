          A middle-aged man with a kind demeanor, standing about 5'10" tall,
          with a lean but slightly muscular build. His face carries the marks of
          experienceâ€”laugh lines at the corners of his mouth and a faint scar
          just above his left eyebrow. His deep-set hazel eyes are framed by
          thick brows and a pair of rectangular glasses that give him an
          intellectual air. His short, slightly wavy dark brown hair is streaked
          with touches of gray at the temples. He wears a simple outfit: a
          button-up navy shirt tucked into well-worn jeans, with a leather belt
          and sturdy brown boots. His hands are calloused, suggesting a life of
          both mental and physical work, and his voice carries a calm, steady
          tone that puts others at ease.
